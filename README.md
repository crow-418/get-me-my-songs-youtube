script to get you your songs on youtube music

## Use
To use this script, navigate to the playlist on `music.youtube.com` from which you want to extract the song names.

Then head into your browser console on that playlist page.

This can be done by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` and clicking on the `console` tag.

Then paste the contents of the `script.js` file inside the console.

Name your file. It will then be downloaded as a `.txt` file.

You should then have a .txt file which will contain the name of your songs followed by the name of the artist
